# 8-bit infosec

Using the simple but brilliant template from https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now
This is my personal infosec blog. Basically I will rant about my personal learnings, exploits and anything I find.
I am not a researcher just a guy who enjoys security and learning, I will however hype up any finding of my own.
