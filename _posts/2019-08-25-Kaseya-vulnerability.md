<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h3>Product</h3>
Kaseya virtual agent provides a web application interface for managing and monitoring IT assets via deployed agents.
Its a competitor for Microsofts system center and has a small portion of the market around 5%.
The agent itself looks to be a several tools bundled together instead of a dedicated agent leveraging host capabilities such as PowerShell, WScript as well as a couple of binaries like curl which are dropped.


<h3>Vulnerability</h3>

<h3>Impact</h3>
Given that Kaseya virtual agent is an IT managment tool if the  agent is deployed on a single machine within an organisation there is a good chance it has been deployed across the majority of the systems. However the vulnerability itself is reliant on code execution within the working folder. This is dependant on scheduled tasks or an administrator executing tasks so the wait time can vary from 1 hour a day or week.
